# Guitar-Tabbing-Tool
The idea is to take in any isolated guitar track of your choice from any song and create a tablature sheet from the track. The tabs may not be an exact one-to-one replica of the original track (depending on the track's complexity), but rather serve as a starting point and frame of guidance for guitarists trying to learn songs quickly.
